            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system.The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education systems.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE </p>
